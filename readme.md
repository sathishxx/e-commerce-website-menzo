# Menzo Men's Fashion

This project is a simple static website for **Menzo Men's Fashion**, showcasing an e-commerce store with a landing page, home, about, collections, and contact pages.

## 🔥 How CSS is Managed

✅ All CSS is included **directly in each HTML file** using `<style>` tags inside the `<head>` section.  
✅ There is **no separate CSS file** (like `style.css`) in this project.  
✅ If you need to edit the styles, simply open the HTML file and update the CSS within the `<style>` block.

## 📁 Files

- `index.html`: Landing page with a logo and **Shop Now** button.
- `home.html`: Main homepage with navigation, featured content, etc.
- `about.html`: About us section with company details.
- `collections.html`: Showcasing various collections.
- `contact.html`: Contact information and social media links.

## ✏️ Editing CSS

To change styles:

1. Open the HTML file you want to edit.
2. Find the `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` section.
3. Update the CSS directly in that section.
4. Save the file and refresh the browser to see the changes.

### Example

```html
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: white;
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }
    /* other CSS rules... */
  </style>
</head>
